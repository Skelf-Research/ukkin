# Welcome to Ukkin

**Ukkin** is a powerful AI-powered mobile agent platform that automates tasks directly on your phone. Create personal AI agents that work in the background to monitor, automate, and streamline your digital life.

## What is Ukkin?

Ukkin lets you create intelligent agents that can:

- **Monitor social media** - Track competitors, hashtags, and mentions across Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, and more
- **Manage communications** - Automatically triage emails, organize messages, and respond to important contacts
- **Watch prices** - Get alerts when products drop in price on Amazon, Flipkart, and other shopping sites
- **Automate anything** - Create custom agents using natural language to automate any repetitive task

## Key Features

### On-Device AI Processing
All AI computation happens locally on your phone. Your data never leaves your device, ensuring complete privacy and security.

### Natural Language Agent Creation
Simply describe what you want automated in plain English. Ukkin's conversational agent builder transforms your description into a working automation.

### Background Execution
Agents run silently in the background, executing on your schedule without requiring the app to be open.

### Smart Scheduling
Agents respect your device's battery level, network connection, and active apps to run at optimal times.
